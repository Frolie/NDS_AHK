NDS_AHK is a simple [AutoHotkey](https://github.com/AutoHotkey/AutoHotkey) program to add hotkeys to Lumen/CenturyLink's propriety software NDS.

## Known issues

Placing and deleting annotations via hotkey will more likely than not make the viewport jump downwards a ton. Will probably get around to fixing it sometime in the near future.

## Personal Note

This is my first project that sparked my interest in programming. The ability to solve problems with something I put effort into making myself was an exciting and satisfying experience for me that pushed me to learn more and keep growing.
